/// This class applies the **Decorator Pattern** to any existing `ITransport` implementation,
/// adding automatic retransmission capabilities without modifying the underlying transport logic.
/// 
/// ### The Reliability Stack
/// It functions as the entry point to the reliability system, routing outgoing messages 
/// through the `RetryMonitor` to ensure delivery guarantees (ACKs) are met.

/// **Key Responsibilities:**
/// 1. **Send Interception**: Redirects `Send()` calls to `RetryMonitor::SendWithRetry()`.
/// 2. **Receive Pass-through**: Forwards `Receive()` calls directly to the physical transport 
///    (no interference with incoming data).
/// 
/// @brief Notes on Packet Ordering and Reliability
///
/// The DelegateMQ reliability layer (RetryMonitor) ensures *eventual delivery*, 
/// but the order of execution depends heavily on the underlying transport:
///
/// 1. **UDP / Serial (Unordered Transports)**:
///    These transports do not buffer or reorder packets. If Packet #2 is lost 
///    and re-transmitted by the RetryMonitor, the Receiver will process them 
///    in the order of arrival: #1 -> #3 -> #2 (Retry). 
///    *Application logic must be robust against out-of-order updates.*
///
/// 2. **TCP (Ordered Stream)**:
///    The TCP protocol stack enforces strict ordering. If Packet #2 is lost 
///    (tcp segment loss), the OS holds Packet #3 in the kernel buffer until 
///    #2 is retransmitted by the TCP stack itself. The Receiver application 
///    will always see: #1 -> #2 -> #3.
///    *Note: If the TCP connection is fully severed and re-connected, the 
///    DelegateMQ retry logic may kick in, potentially leading to duplicates 
///    or ordering issues across the connection boundary.*
